# üåç Atmos Viz: Global Temperature Analysis and Prediction
## Overview
### Atmos Viz is a Python-based project designed to analyze, visualize, and predict global temperature trends across various cities and countries. It leverages historical climate data and advanced data science techniques, combining machine learning models, geospatial mapping, and interactive visualizations to uncover meaningful insights into temperature variations over time.

### Project Features

#### ‚úÖ Data Preprocessing: Efficiently handles large-scale datasets, cleans missing values, and extracts relevant features like Year, Month, and cyclic seasonal trends.
#### ‚úÖ Geospatial Mapping: Visualizes temperature data geographically using shapefiles and tools like GeoPandas and Plotly.
#### ‚úÖ Machine Learning Prediction: Forecasts future temperature trends using Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
#### ‚úÖ Interactive Visualizations: Generates engaging charts, heatmaps, and world maps for better analysis and understanding.
#### ‚úÖ Performance Evaluation: Measures model accuracy using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤.



### Technologies Used

#### Programming Language: Python

### Libraries:

#### Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
#### Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
#### Geospatial Mapping: GeoPandas
#### Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
#### GIS Tools: Shapefiles



### Project Workflow

#### Data Preprocessing

##### Load the temperature dataset (sourced from Kaggle, originally from Berkeley Earth).
##### Clean and normalize missing temperature values using monthly means.
##### Extract cyclic seasonal trends using sine and cosine transformations.


### Model Development

#### Use Linear Regression and Random Forest for predictive modeling.
#### Train models using features like Year, sin_month, and cos_month.
#### Evaluate performance using MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤ metrics.


## Visualization

#### Geospatial Maps: Display temperature data using GeoPandas and Plotly.
#### Time-Series Trends: Plot temperature trends with trendlines for specific cities.
#### Interactive Maps: Visualize data with hover information for cities on the map.
#### Heatmaps & Boxplots: Analyze monthly and regional temperature variations.
